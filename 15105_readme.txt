How to Run the Code
Step 1: Create make files by performing the below commands
'make 15105_server'
'make 15105_client'

Step 2: Start the server with the following command
'./15105_server'

Step 3: Open a new Terminal window and Start the client with the following command
'./15105_client'

P.S - The Client can quit by either typing 'quit()' in the command or by keyboard interrupt (control+c)

Assumption - By broadcasting to all the clients I am assuming all the clients can see the server page(terminal window)
